He was Chinese, and she felt connected to the particular set of pressures he faced. She read through old, anonymous course evaluations, looking for any sign she might have missed. But she was unsure where to put her personal feelings about a loss suffered in this professional context.The week before the academic year began, a second student died. A rising senior in the computer-science department who loved horticulture took his own life. This brought an intimation of disaster. One student suicide is a tragedy; two might be the beginning of a cluster. Some faculty members began to feel a tinge of dread when they stepped onto campus.Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Massachusetts is a tidy New England college campus with the high-saturation landscaping typical of well-funded institutions. The hedges are beautifully trimmed, the pathways are swept clean. Red-brick buildings from the 19th century fraternize with high glass facades and renovated interiors.

At her feet was a dead body in a pool of blood, and moving all around her were dozens of police officers and other investigators taking photos and collecting evidence. But none of those things or those other people stood out to Anna, because right now, the only thing she could think about was what she saw on the wall. She had never seen anything like this before... well, except for in movies, but no, sure enough, when she walked up to the wall, she realized that the thing that was on the wall was very real. And very, very disturbing. Possibly more disturbing, at least psychologically, than the dead body nearby. And it would be this discovery on the wall that would lead police to one of the coldest killers in Florida history.For 100s more stories like these, check out our main YouTube channel just called ""MrBallen"" --  you want to reach out to me, contact me on Instagram, Twitter or any other major social media platform, my username on all of them is @mrballenSee Privacy Policy at  and California Privacy Notice at "

Mark thought this was odd, but he tried not to over think it and just kept on sipping his coffee. The strange man started talking to Mark, just small talk, and Mark responded politely. But when his car was finally done, Mark was very relieved to grab his keys and get out of there. As Mark drove home, he couldn't help but feel like that strange guy was off in some way, there had to be a reason why he just randomly sat down next to Mark despite the open seats, and then why had he tried so hard to strike up a conversation? It all just seemed very odd but by the time Mark got home, he had forgotten about the guy. However, the guy had not forgotten about Mark, because Mark was right to be suspicious. That strange man had a very specific reason for doing what he did, and it was about to have massive ripple effects.For 100s more stories like these, check out our main YouTube channel just called ""MrBallen"" --  you want to reach out to me, contact me on Instagram, Twitter or any other major social media platform, my username on all of them is @mrballenSee Privacy Policy at  and California Privacy Notice at "

Morbid,1cpyLfDHP1cNnyOb478qrt,Episode 536: The Murder of Gary Triano,"The show description is: It’s a lighthearted nightmare in here, weirdos! Morbid is a true crime, creepy history and all things spooky podcast hosted by an autopsy technician and a hairstylist. Join us for a heavy dose of research with a dash of comedy thrown in for flavor. The episode description is: On the evening of November 1, 1996, Tucson, Arizona real estate developer and businessman Gary Triano got into his car at the La Paloma Country Club intending to head home, where friends and family were waiting for Gary’s surprise birthday party. However, before Gary had even put the key in the ignition, the car exploded in a ball of flame, plunging the club into panic and chaos, and killing Gary instantly. To investigators, the car bomb planted under Gary’s car had all the hallmarks of a professional hit, and with Gary’s business dealings and financial troubles, there were at least a few people who would have benefitted from his death. However, within just a few weeks, suspicion fell to Triano’s ex-wife, Pamela, who’d taken out a life insurance policy on Gary during their marriage that would eventually pay out $2 million dollars.Despite being confident that Pamela was involved in Gary’s death, the year-long investigation failed to turn up any conclusive evidence tying her to the murder. Undeterred, investigators continued to pursue the case across the country and eventually around the world and in 2009, more than a decade after his death, the people responsible for Gary Triano’s death were finally arrested, but many years would pass before anyone was held accountable.Thank you to David White, of the Bring Me the Axe Podcast for research!ReferencesBodfield, Rhonda. 1996.

Morbid,1cpyLfDHP1cNnyOb478qrt,Episode 535: Florence Burns and the Murder of Walter Brooks,"The show description is: It’s a lighthearted nightmare in here, weirdos! Morbid is a true crime, creepy history and all things spooky podcast hosted by an autopsy technician and a hairstylist. Join us for a heavy dose of research with a dash of comedy thrown in for flavor. The episode description is: When twenty-year-old Walter Brooks was found dead from a bullet to the head on Valentine’s Day 1902, suspicion immediately fell on Brooks’ nineteen-year-old sometimes-girlfriend, Florence Burns. The two were known to have a tumultuous relationship and had fought violently on the morning of his death, and there was considerable evidence indicating that Burns had been in the hotel room at the time of Brooks’ murder. However, despite all the evidence indicating guilt, Florence Burns was never brought to trial for Brooks’ murder or even formally charged with a crime, and Walter Brooks murder officially remains an unsolved case in New York.While the story of Walter Brooks and Florence Burns is relatively uncomplicated in terms of the crime around which the story is built, the story is a remarkable illustration of the ways in which things like class, gender, and technological advances can influence and even shape how the law is applied in the United States. Indeed, at the time of the murder, the nation was undergoing incredibly social and cultural changes as a result of dramatically expanded transportation and communication technology, giving rise to a youth culture the likes of which had never been seen in the nation prior. That youth culture and the rebelliousness it produced in many young wealthy Americans played a direct role, not only in Walter’s life and death, but also in the socio-cultural perspectives and Victorian beliefs that allowed Florence to get away with murder.Thank you to the wondrous Dave White of Bring me the Axe Podcast & 99 Cent Rental for Research!ReferencesEvening World. 1902.

Morbid,1cpyLfDHP1cNnyOb478qrt,Episode 533: The Mysterious Death of Charles Morgan,"The show description is: It’s a lighthearted nightmare in here, weirdos! Morbid is a true crime, creepy history and all things spooky podcast hosted by an autopsy technician and a hairstylist. Join us for a heavy dose of research with a dash of comedy thrown in for flavor. The episode description is: In March 1977, Arizona businessman Charles Morgan went missing from his home in Tucson, only to turn up three days later in the middle of the night, shoeless, traumatized, and with broken plastic handcuffs on his wrists and ankles. Unable to speak, Charles wrote that he had been drugged by an unnamed individual and kidnapped, but he refused to let his wife call the police or otherwise report the assault. Three months later, Charles Morgan’s body was discovered in the desert with a gunshot wound in the back of his head, one of his teeth wrapped in a handkerchief, and a two-dollar bill pinned to his underwear.From the outside, Charles Morgan appeared to live a very normal and decidedly unexciting life. Yet when investigators began digging into his background to find out who would have wanted him dead, they discovered a complicated and bizarre story of supposed government agents, mobsters, and a mystery that one would have expected from a Hollywood screenplay, not the life of a middle-aged Arizona escrow agent. The increasingly bizarre details of Morgan’s life and death comprise a fascinating mystery that remains unsolved to this day and endures as one of Arizona’s most baffling cold cases.Thank you to David White, of the Bring Me the Axe podcast, for research assistanceReferencesBassett, Edward, and David Dykes. 1977.

Morbid is a true crime, creepy history and all things spooky podcast hosted by an autopsy technician and a hairstylist. Join us for a heavy dose of research with a dash of comedy thrown in for flavor. The episode description is: When Sandy Bird was found dead in her wrecked car in the Cottonwood River in the summer of 1983, everyone assumed the thirty-three-year-old Kansas mother of three had misjudged the turn on the one-lane bridge and gone over the side, her death a tragic accident. Similarly, when Martin Anderson was gunned down on the side of a Kansas state road just a few months later, the residents of Emporia, KS believed he was the victim of robbery gone wrong—the kind of random violence that investigators often struggled to solve. What no one knew at the time was that the ostensibly accidental death of Sandy Bird and the tragic murder of Martin Anderson were in fact linked by a conspiracy of Sandra’s husband, Tom Bird, and his mistress, Lorna Anderson, designed to rid themselves of their respective spouses. Unfortunately, their plot began unraveling just a few weeks after Martin’s murder and both Tom and Lorna were arrested for the murders, along with their co-conspirators, and eventually went to trial. While the murders shocked the communities in rural Kansas, the most unbelievable aspect of the case was that the killers were a Lutheran pastor and his devout secretary.Thank you to the wonderful, David White of the Bring Me the Axe podcast, for research assistance!ReferencesClose, Dan. 1984.

Support this podcast:  The episode description is: the power of our attention and focus is something that often goes unnoticed. so many of us are unconsciously manifesting the very thing we say we don't want by lending our attention to it. what we focus on magnifies in various ways. as humans, our brains are wired to find the familiar. and with that familiarity, we unconsciously replay a certain narrative within our inner worlds over and over again. by doing so, we allow ourselves to believe that narrative is truth. then we unconsciously take certain actions to make the narrative truth- expanding the focus into our physical reality. in another instance, when we focus on something (whether we want it or not), we are sending a signal to the universe that we are energetically aligned with the thing that we are focused on. hence, magnifying our focus and attention. for many of us, we have unconsciously lended our focus to a multitude of energies that didn't serve us on all levels. when you intentionally allow your focus to expand to higher energy fields, not only will your inner world align with that energy but your physical reality will very much be in alignment as well.

McMahon, MD, founder of Whole World Healthcare has been practicing pediatrics in Roswell, New Mexico, for 26 years. His interest in Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (CIRS) began in 2009. Dr. McMahon first learned about CIRS after being approached by a businessman whose daughter became ill while attending a local school. The search for this child’s healing led him to Dr. Richie Shoemaker, the global expert on mold illnesses. McMahon visited Dr. Shoemaker’s practice to learn about the treatment for CIRS and saw the tremendous need for more physicians prepared to treat CIRS. He immediately opened a practice in Roswell specifically to diagnose and treat patients with CIRS, starting with 15 patients from the local school. His CIRS practice has now grown and he has seen thousands of adults and children to date. - Links - For Dr. McMahon and Dr. Shoemaker: Surviving Mold (website)  CIRC Diagnoses  Boot Camp: A Beginners Guide to Spiritual Warfare The Art and Science of CIRS Medicine "

Sold a Story,0tcUMXBFMGMe8w79MM5QCI,[RERELEASE] At a Loss for Words: What's Wrong with How Schools Teach Reading,"The show description is: Millions of kids can't read well. Scientists have known for decades how children learn to read but many schools are ignoring the research. They buy teacher training and books that are rooted in a disproven idea. Emily Hanford investigates four authors and a publishing company that have made millions selling this idea. The episode description is: Molly Woodworth had a secret: She couldn’t read very well. She fought her way through text by looking at the first letter of a word and thinking of something that made sense.  Reading was slow and laborious. Then she learned that her daughter's school was actually teaching kids to read that way. In this documentary, originally published in August 2019, host Emily Hanford reveals that many kids are being taught the habits of struggling readers. Winner of a Gracie Award and finalist for an EWA Public Service Award.  Read more: How a flawed idea is teaching millions of kids to be poor readersSupport this show: Donate to APM Reports"

The key to building deep connections with others, says David Brooks, is to make them feel seen and heard.Brooks is a writer for the New York Times, the Atlantic, and the best-selling author of several books. In his latest, How to Know a Person: The Art of Seeing Others Deeply and Being Deeply Seen, he explores how vulnerability — both being vulnerable ourselves and creating space for others to be as well — is the key to fostering deeper connections at home, at work, and throughout our lives. “[People] need to be seen, heard, and understood,” he says. “If you hide yourself from the emotional intimacies of life, you're hiding yourself from life itself.”In this episode of Think Fast, Talk Smart, Brooks and host Matt Abrahams discuss the fundamentals of communicating with vulnerability and empathy, outlining the skills that anyone can learn and use to connect more deeply in their relationships.Episode Reference Links:Full list of David Brooks booksBryan StevensonGeorge OrwellC.S.

The episode description is: If we want to generate better ideas, then we need to get people back to the office.In this bonus meetings mini-series episode, we feature an episode from the newest podcast from Stanford Graduate School of Business – If/Then: Business, Leadership, Society. In this conversation with senior editor Kevin Cool, Professor of Marketing and former TFTS guest Jonathan Levav details his study of remote work and creativity. “Pairs that worked face-to-face generated 15 to 20% more ideas than pairs that worked on Zoom,” Levav notes. What’s more, in-person brainstorming helped people consider a wider and more diverse range of possibilities. “Working on Zoom was a double penalty. Fewer ideas — and a narrower set of ideas.”Remote work may be the new normal in our post-pandemic world, but Levav cautions us from accepting the status quo — especially if we want to keep our creative edge. As this episode of If/Then explores, our best ideas could still lie ahead of us — if we can all get in the same room.If/Then is a podcast from the Stanford Graduate School of Business that examines research findings that can help us navigate the complex issues we face in business, leadership, and society. Each episode features an interview with a Stanford GSB faculty member.   Key Takeaways: For hybrid work environments, managers should select “in-office” days based on tasks we perform better in person, such as collaboration and brainstorming.More flexible schedules for remote and office work allow employees to bring their best selves and perform better at their jobs.  More Resources: Listen to Jonathan Levav’s Webby-Award winning TFTS episode: ""88.

This was all made worse by the contrast between Biden and the president of Russia, whose interview with Tucker Carlson was posted yesterday. Also, the democrat mayor of a small town scams her constituents out of thousands of dollars but says they have no right to question her, because she's a black woman. A Hollywood actor says that he had to seek therapy to deal with bad reviews. And the internet rallies around a homeless guy, raises almost half a million dollars for him, only to find out that he's actually a violent criminal. Ep.1312 - - -  DailyWire+:  Want to work at The Daily Wire?

The episode description is: Millions of children fall asleep to some kind of baby white noise every night! The sound of a fan for sleep can create such a soothing environment for your child, helping cover up background distractions that can keep them awake. If your baby often falls asleep to fan sounds, but tonight it may be too cold to have it on, play this baby sleep sound so they can snooze! Next time your baby struggles to get some shut-eye, try this fan noise for sleeping. While playing white noise for babies, it’s important to keep tabs on the volume, because any white noise machine, smartphone, or computer can put out levels that are too loud for your child. It's recommended to play the sound at least a few feet from where your infant is sleeping and to keep the volume no louder than the sound of a soft shower. Parents can download an app to turn their smartphone into a sound level meter. One good, free, option is the sound level meter app created by the U.S. National Institutes for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) available on the app store as the NIOSH SLM app. Here are some great products to help you sleep!

Kendall's approach to true-crime content is empathetic and always approached with victims in mind first. Join Kendall in her journey to spread awareness and bring justice to those who need it most! The episode description is: Myrtle Simmons-Brown was not just a loving mother, but a leader in her community. Myrtle had just turned 73 and was living in Maywood, Illinois, with her oldest son, Sergio Brown. Sergio is known for his 7 successful seasons playing in the NFL, and for reasons we don’t know, he had moved in with his mom and didn’t have much to his name. And on September 14th and 15th 2023, when neither responded to loved ones, people grew concerned. So, on September 16th, a loved one went to their house to check up on them but found nothing - no sign of forced entry nor of Myrtle and Sergio. It wasn’t until family members reported them missing to police that neighbors got involved in the search. And it was only then, late on the 16th, that Myrtle’s naked body was found wrapped in plastic in a creek bed 150 feet from her own back door. After days of looking for Sergio, he was located in Mexico where he had made several concerning posts on Instagram. He was eventually extradited back to Maywood, where he is now facing a 1st-degree murder charge and a concealment of a dead body charge.

The episode description is: Madison Marie Russo was a 19-year-old college student at St. Ambrose University who, for actual reasons we may never know, decided to fake having cancer. Her scheme began on TikTok where she spread her story to thousands of people willing to listen, pray, and follow her along her “cancer journey.” It wasn’t until anonymous witnesses brought her story to the police, citing medical discrepancies in her story. Investigators subpoenaed her medical records and it confirmed what many suspected - Maddie did not have cancer. But for months, she was able to solicit $37,303 on GoFundMe, not to mention that she was supported by several foundations, funds, and schools. She tricked innocent people into giving her money to fight a disease she never had. Maddie was thankfully arrested and charged with theft by means of deception in January of 2023, and in October was finally sentenced to 3 years probation and restitution.

The two seemed to have developed a friendship and even when they weren’t working, they sometimes spent time together. However, on June 7th, 2023, Valerie went to work that afternoon for Patrick and vanished. After being reported missing, Patrick told police she did not work for him that day, and that he hadn’t seen her. He ended up changing his story to say that he WAS with her that day, but that he saw her get into another man’s car and drive away. Because he lied to officers, he was initially charged with false informing. Then, on November 28th, a search warrant was executed on his property, and sadly her remains were found in a homemade wooden box made of 2x4s. He was arrested, charged with murder, and quickly confessed to strangling her with his belt. He claims Valerie was trying to blackmail him into buying her a car.

However, on January 18th, 2021, he reported her missing after returning from work and not being able to find her. As HIS story goes, he and Trina went to a campsite on January 16th together and didn’t bring their phones because they were doing a “digital detox.” Nobody knows what the couple did on the 17th, because unfortunately, Iain has been super vague about the details… Police and volunteers searched high and low for her, and then, over 2 months later, her remains were uncovered near the area of the campsite they visited that weekend. Is it just a terrible coincidence her remains were found where he said they last visited... or is he responsible?

However, just days before the race, Mo was shot and killed inside a friend’s house. Investigators would quickly learn that Mo had spent the day with Colin Strickland, a guy she dated for about 2 weeks the previous October. Within the first 24 hours they had their suspect, and it was Colin’s on-again / off-again girlfriend, Kaitlin Armstrong. Surveillance cameras place her car circling the place of the murder the hour leading up to the shooting, her gun matched the shell casings found around Mo’s body, and much more. All the evidence pointed to Kaitlin. But before police could make an arrest, she fled to Costa Rica using her sister’s passport. It took over 40 days to locate her, but once they did, she was arrested and charged with 1st-degree murder. While in custody, she made a failed escape attempt too, but in the end, she was ultimately sentenced to 90 years in prison.

True Crime with Kendall Rae,4d6RwH9XKnZ6osfNVc26eJ,She Recorded Her Killer Yet Authorities Botched the Investigation: The Murder of Amber Tuccaro,"The show description is: Kendall Rae is a true-crime content creator on YouTube who has used her platform to spread awareness for victims and their families.

Kendall's approach to true-crime content is empathetic and always approached with victims in mind first. Join Kendall in her journey to spread awareness and bring justice to those who need it most! The episode description is: Amber Alyssa Tuccaro was a young mother and member of the Mikisew Cree First Nation, living in Fort McMurray, Canada. In August of 2010, while on a trip to Edmonton with her son and a friend, Amber decided to hitchhike into the city, but after doing so, she was never seen again. Her mom reported her missing. However, the RCMP wouldn't listen and didn't care. They did next to nothing to search for Amber and even destroyed her personal belongings. For 2 years, her family was without answers until August of 2012 came around, and the RCMP released a 1-minute recording from a 17-minute call that Amber placed on the day it's believed she died. That day, Amber called her brother and because he was incarcerated, it was recorded and stored. In the recording, you can hear Amber begin to worry that the man who picked her up is not taking her where she wants to go. Her body was found 4 days after the recording was released, and there has been no justice to this day.   National Indigenous Women's Resource Center:  Reclaiming Power & Peace:   RCMP Investigation Report:  RCMP Alberta on Twitter:   I am requesting information on the murder of First Nation's woman Amber Tuccaro.

The episode description is: Joe McMoneagle is a former U.S. Army Chief Warrant Officer and was among the first Remote Viewers to be recruited into the previously classified Stargate Project. Project Stargate was the United States' first organized research into psychic phenomena via the Defense Intelligence Agency and contractor SRI International. In this episode, McMoneagle takes us back to the early days of the Vietnam War and how he was recruited into intelligence operations. The height of the Cold War fueled appetites for advantages over the United States' enemies and gave way to the CIA's push into ""psychic and extra sensory perception"" research and military applications. Post his military retirement, McMoneagle authored several books to critical acclaim like ""The Stargate Chronicles: Memoirs of a Psychic Spy"" and continued his work via his private venture–Intuitive Intelligence Applications, Inc. He now teaches Remote Viewing at The Monroe Institute, a world leader in human consciousness exploration.

American Terror,2G3qmhWe8reqyCc7SRqI8F,Painkiller: America’s Fentanyl Crisis - UPDATE: The End of Pain,"The show description is: The United States is fighting a forever war at home, against far-right extremism. Join host Ben Makuch as he exposes domestic terror groups and breaks down what you need to know - and how they might be stopped. The episode description is: For over 30 years, Danny Elliot suffered from severe chronic pain, the aftermath of nearly getting electrocuted to death in a home accident. The only thing that eased his pain was the powerful synthetic opioid fentanyl, which was prescribed to him by a doctor. But in recent years, it had become almost impossible for Danny to obtain fentanyl—even with a prescription. With illicit fentanyl made by Mexican cartels causing thousands of overdose deaths, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has been cracking down on all sources of supply—including doctors suspected of operating illegally and over-prescribing. A week after the DEA’s visit to Danny’s third  doctor in four years, he killed himself. His wife of 25 years, Gretchen Elliott, also took her own life at the same time. VICE News correspondent Keegan Hamilton first spoke to Danny two years ago for an episode of the podcast series “PAINKILLER: America’s Fentanyl Crisis”. This week, he went to Danny’s funeral and talked with friends and family who told a story of a tragedy that was as predictable as it was avoidable. This story was reported and produced by Keegan Hamilton and Jesse Alejandro Cottrell. It was edited by Stephanie Kariuki and Annie Aviles.

Welcome to Rotten Mango but don’t worry it all comes with a seasoning of comedy/sweetness. The episode description is: “I can’t let you in…” The housekeeper was confused - what does the mom mean she can’t let me in? “Could you just toss the keys from your balcony?” The mother threw her keys from the balcony and vanished into the house. The housekeeper walked into the house and it was immediately chaos. The mother was hysterical - the father was banging his head on the wall. The mother threw her arms around the housekeeper. She cried and ushered her to a bedroom, “Come, come, inside and see what happened!” Lying in her bed was the family’s 13 year old daughter, dead. Her throat slit ear to ear. Her body looked posed and so were her stuffed animals, though they were eerily free of any blood or splatter. This case would become known as the JonBenét Ramsey case of India. Rumors of cheating, black mail, revenge, honor killings, truth serum, grooming and orgies consumed the media but the only thing we know for certain is - whoever her killer or killers are – they are free.

But all of it made me surer than ever that the stories we tell—to ourselves and to each other—can heal, they can help us grow, and make us think. But mostly, stories are how we connect. That’s what led me to this podcast, to a place where we can share our stories together.” The series will feature solo conversations between Chip and Jo, along with other special guests, plus stories from others mixed in along the way. There is hope and power in living out the fullness of your story. But you don’t have to write it alone.
